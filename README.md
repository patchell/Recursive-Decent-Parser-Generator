# Recursive-Decent-Parser-Generator
This is a learning experience for me.  Don't take this too seriously

I hope that eventually it will be a real parser generator.  
Not that the world really needs another parser generator.  
There is Antlr, Bison, PRECCX and a whole hose of other parser
generators that will be  a whole lot more than anything I can 
create.  Still, there are a lot of useful classes in this project.
